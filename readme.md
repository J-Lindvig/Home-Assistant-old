# Home Assistant by J-Lindvig
This is my implementation of Home Assistant, it may not be for the faint of heart - but it is mine and I like it....
Please enjoy my madness and use what you can.
## Introduction
In my setup I have 2 instances of Home Assistant, a master and a slave. They are connected using [remote homeassistant](https://github.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote).
The reason why I am using 2 Home Assistants is that I have 2 IKEA TRÅDFRI Gateways and each Home Assistant can *only* control one. Off course I could use another Zigbee gateway solution, but I was offered a second Gateway very cheap and wanted to distribute the payload.
## Master
The is the one in control, storing the recorder, having all the automations and scripts. Basically everything.
Furthermore it is the master who is serving the nicely formed GUI.
